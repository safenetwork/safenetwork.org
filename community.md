## Getting started

The most important resources for those new to the SAFE Network are:

- [safenetwork.tech](https://safenetwork.tech/) – a website about the SAFE Network that contains many useful pages such as:
  - [Network Fundamentals](https://safenetwork.tech/fundamentals/)
  - [How It Works](https://safenetwork.tech/how-it-works/)
  - [Safecoin](https://safenetwork.tech/safecoin/) (only the proxy token [MAID](https://safenetwork.tech/faq/#how-do-i-buy-safecoin) is available at the moment)
- [safenetforum.org](https://safenetforum.org/) – the main discussion forum of the SAFE Network community

If you are a developer, we also recommend looking at these resources:

- [hub.safedev.org](https://hub.safedev.org/) – documentation and tutorials for developers who want to build apps that use the SAFE API

## Chat rooms

The [SAFE Network Forum](https://safenetforum.org) is great for having in-depth discussions on topics related to the SAFE Network. But in some cases, maybe you don’t feel like creating a new forum topic. For example, you might prefer to first ask your question in a chat room and only create a new forum topic if necessary.

All the chat rooms below are bridged together. For example, any messages you post on Matrix will automatically show up on Telegram, Discord and Gitter.
