We also use the following subreddits:

## Chats

The [#safenetwork:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#safenetwork:matrix.org) channel can be used for general discussion about the SAFE Network, and it's a good place to ask for help.

This channel is bridged with:

- [#safenetwork](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/safenetwork) on freenode
- [safenetwork.slack.com](https://slack.safenetwork.org)

## Meetup groups

SAFE Network enthusiasts meet periodically in [meetup groups](/meetup-groups/). It's a great introduction to the community and a great way to learn and socialize with other people with a similar interest. Meetups are usually informal and open to everyone.
