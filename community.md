## Getting started

The most important resources for those new to the SAFE Network are:

- The [SAFE Network Forum](https://safenetforum.org), the main discussion forum of the SAFE Network community.
- [maidsafe.net](https://maidsafe.net), the website of MaidSafe, a Scottish company that has been working on designing and implementing the SAFE Network since 2006.
- The [SAFE Dev Forum](https://forum.safedev.org), a discussion forum about the core libraries and APIs of the SAFE Network.

## Apps

- [apps.safenetwork.org](https://apps.safenetwork.org/)

## Support

Here are the best places to ask for help:

- Ask questions on the [SAFE Network Forum](https://safenetforum.org/) (e.g., in [#support](https://safenetforum.org/c/support))
- Get live support on [#safenetwork:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#safenetwork:matrix.org)

## Chats

The [SAFE Network Forum](https://safenetforum.org) is great for having in-depth discussions on subjects related to the SAFE Network. But in some cases maybe you don't feel like creating a new topic. For example, you might prefer to first ask your question in a chat room and only create a new topic if necessary.

The [#safenetwork:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#safenetwork:matrix.org) room can be used for general discussion about the SAFE Network, and it's a good place to ask for help! It's bridged with [#safenetwork](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/safenetwork) on freenode and [safenetwork.slack.com](https://slack.safenetwork.org).

The [#safenetwork-dev:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#safenetwork-dev:matrix.org) room can be used for technical discussion about the [SAFE API](https://api.safedev.org/) and the core libraries of the SAFE Network, and it's a good place to talk with other developers! It's bridged with [#safenetwork-dev](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/safenetwork-dev) on freenode and [safenetwork.slack.com](https://slack.safenetwork.org).

## Meetup groups

SAFE Network enthusiasts meet periodically in [meetup groups](/meetup-groups/). It's a great introduction to the community and a great way to learn and socialize with other people with a similar interest. Meetups are usually informal and open to everyone.
