## Getting started

The most important resources for those new to the SAFE Network are:

- [safenetforum.org](https://safenetforum.org): the main discussion forum of the SAFE Network community.
- [maidsafe.net](https://maidsafe.net): the website of MaidSafe, a Scottish company that has been working on designing and implementing the SAFE Network since 2006.
- [forum.safedev.org](https://forum.safedev.org): a discussion forum about the core libraries and APIs of the SAFE Network.

## Apps

## Support

Here are the best places to ask for help:

## Chats

The [SAFE Network Forum](https://safenetforum.org) is great for having in-depth discussions on subjects related to the SAFE Network. But in some cases maybe you don't feel like creating a new topic. For example, you might prefer to first ask your question in a chat room and only create a new topic if necessary.

The [#safenetwork:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#safenetwork:matrix.org) room can be used for general discussion about the SAFE Network, and it's a good place to ask for help! It's bridged with the [SAFE Network Telegram group](https://t.me/safenetwork), the <b>#general</b> channel of the [SAFE Network Slack](https://slack.safenetwork.org) and [#safenetwork](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/safenetwork) on freenode.

The [#safenetwork-dev:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#safenetwork-dev:matrix.org) room can be used for technical discussion about the core libraries and APIs of the SAFE Network, and it's a good place to talk with other developers! It's bridged with the [SAFE Developers Telegram group](https://t.me/safedev), the <b>#development</b> channel of the [SAFE Network Slack](https://slack.safenetwork.org) and [#safenetwork-dev](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/safenetwork-dev) on freenode.

The [#safemarkets:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#safemarkets:matrix.org) room can be used for discussion about MaidSafeCoin/Safecoin and other cryptocurrency trading chat. It's bridged with the [MAID Trading Telegram group](https://t.me/maidsafecoin), the <b>#trading</b> channel of the [SAFE Network Slack](https://slack.safenetwork.org) and [#maidsafecoin](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/maidsafecoin) on freenode.

Any messages you post in the Matrix rooms mentioned above will automatically show up on Telegram, Slack and IRC (and vice versa: if other users post messages on Telegram, Slack or IRC, you will receive them via Matrix).

## Reddit

We mainly use the [/r/safenetwork](https://www.reddit.com/r/safenetwork) subreddit.

Previously, we were also using the /r/maidsafe subreddit, but MaidSafe recently decided to archive /r/maidsafe so that we can all focus our attention on /r/safenetwork. [See this post](https://safenetforum.org/t/reddit-migration-to-r-safenetwork/20334) for more info.

## Meetup groups

SAFE Network enthusiasts meet periodically in [meetup groups](/meetup-groups/). It's a great introduction to the community and a great way to learn and socialize with other people with a similar interest. Meetups are usually informal and open to everyone.
