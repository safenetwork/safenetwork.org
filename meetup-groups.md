SAFE Network enthusiasts meet periodically in meetup
groups. It's a great introduction to the community and a great way to
learn and socialize with other people with a similar interest. Meetups are usually informal and open to
everyone. If you have started a new meetup group and would like to add it to
this list, please announce it in [#initiatives](https://safenetforum.org/c/community/initiatives) or
even better, open a pull request against
[this website](https://github.com/safenetwork/safenetwork.org/blob/gh-pages/meetup-groups.md).
